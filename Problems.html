<b> High Latency, Ping, or Lag</b>

The physical distance from the servers makes your inputs delayed. People who are far from the server will be at a disadvantage compared to those who are close. Not all people have access to fast internet so there will be another increase in lag.

 <b>Coverage</b>

At the start, only 1st world countries like the United States will be able to have at least close to reliable access to the service. It will take a long time to provide these services to other non-1st world countries like the Philippines due to the naturally slow internet and the long process of bringing the entire service to other countries.

 <b>Costs</b>

Some people like to have their games be a one-time payment deal. Some platforms will still charge you the game's full price in addition to the monthly fee of the service (Google Stadia). You will need to have a good internet speed for this to work so the price of your internet service will also go up.
