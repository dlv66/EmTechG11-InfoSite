<b>PlayStation Now (PC, PS4) </b>
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this, you can play from your PC or your PlayStation 4 a broad range of exclusive PlayStation games. All you need on your PC is a DualShock 4 controller with either a wireless adapter or a USB mini cable, as well as a PlayStation Network account and Internet download speed of at least 5 Mbps. For PS4 players, even if you have not subscribed to PlayStation Plus, a PlayStation Now subscription involves complete access to multiplayer assistance. Save files on both PC and PS4 will be compatible.

<b>GeForce Now (PC, Mac, Nvidia Shield)</b>
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Own a Mac, Nvidia Shield, or a low-end PC, but want the recent AAA games to be played? With GeForce Now, without worrying about your computer catching fire or, worse, running Bootcamp, you can play the latest and biggest from significant publishers. GeForce Now, like many of the other services on our list, is not a content service. You need to buy the games you want to play through a digital shop like Steam, Uplay, or Battle.net from Blizzard. Once you've installed the app on your machine, GeForce's cloud-based processors will allow you to run the game on any device, independent of their specs.

<b>Xbox Game Pass (Xbox One, PC)</b>
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other services on our list are based on streaming technology to deliver your games, but the Xbox Game Pass from Microsoft works a bit differently, which utilizes progressive downloading technology. A subscription to Xbox Game Pass gives you access to more than 100 games for $10 per month, and you download them to the storage device of your Xbox One just like any other digital game. This means that you don't have to worry about the quality of your game experience influencing your internet speed, and even if you lose your link, you can still play games.

<b>Google Stadia (Multi-Platform)</b>
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Project Stream, a service that underwent a closed beta from late 2018 too early 2019, Google made a leap into the game streaming company. They boasted their technology during the Stadia conference where players were able to play Assassin's Creed Odyssey using only a Chrome browser on their desktop, with a download speed of 25 Mbps offering them gameplay almost as smooth as it would be in the native version.
