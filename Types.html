<b>Gaming on Demand </b>
</p>
<img src="img\gnd.png" width="50%">
<p align="justify">
A type of online gaming that allows direct, on-demand video streaming of games onto computers, consoles, and mobile devices, similar to video on demand, through the use of a thin client. 
<br><br>
The actual game is stored, executed, and rendered on the game company's server and the video results are streamed directly to a consumer's computers over the internet. This allows access to games without the need of a console and largely makes the capability of the user's computer unimportant, as the server is the actual system that is running the processing needs. The controls and button presses from the user are transmitted directly to the server, where they are recorded, and the server then sends back the game's response to the input controls. 
<br><br>
It takes advantage of a broadband connection, large server clusters, encryption, and compression to stream game content to a subscriber's device. Users can play games without downloading or installing the actual game. Most cloud gaming platforms are closed and proprietary; the first open-source cloud gaming platform was only released in April, 2013.

<b>P2P Cloudless Gaming </b>
</p>
<img src="img\P2P.png">
<p align="justify">
A type of cloud gaming, where remote computers for game execution represented by community of individuals. The critical difference from cloud gaming is that game is executed on an actual PC and it is streamed on one-to-one basis. The actual game is stored, executed, and rendered on the remote computer station and the video results are streamed directly to a consumer's computer over the Internet. P2P cloudless gaming allows closing latency gap: the remote computer could be located within one internet provider. The network protocol in P2P cloud gaming smartly chooses the best fit between the remote computer and the consumer's device.

<b>Progressive Downloading</b>
</p>
<img src="img\PD.png">
<p align="justify">
Cloud gaming based on file streaming, also known as "progressive downloading", deploys a thin client in which the actual game is run on the user's gaming device, such as a mobile device, a PC, or a console. A small part of a game, usually less than 5% of the total game size, is downloaded initially so that the gamer can start playing quickly. The remaining game content is downloaded to the end user's device while playing. This allows instant access to games with low bandwidth Internet connections without lag. The cloud is used for providing a scalable way of streaming the game content and big data analysis. Cloud gaming based on file streaming requires a device that has the hardware capabilities to operate the game. Often, downloaded game content is stored on the end user's device.
