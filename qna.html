<h4>Q: How is local gaming different from cloud gaming?</h3>
<p><b>A:</b> Local gaming requires you to have the proper hardware in order to play your favorite games. With cloud gaming, your physical hardware doesn’t matter so as long as you have fast internet, a screen, and an input device (such as a controller) because the game company’s servers will be the machines/systems that will run the game then stream the gameplay to your screen via internet.</p>
